Less-Shitty Analysis Base Image
===============================

The analysis base image is sort of shitty: not because the people who
made it did a bad job, just because it's missing a lot of stuff that I
like. This is an attempt to make it slightly less shitty.

Running
=======

First set up a key:

 - Open the [gitlab key entry forum](https://gitlab.cern.ch/profile/keys)
 - run `make-key.sh | pbcopy` and paste into the box there

Then run `build-docker.sh` and `run-docker.sh`
